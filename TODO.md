- MAKE SPIRAL

LAT RINGS ROTATE
THIS IS ALL CONFUSING
VARIABLES NEED LOOKUP TABLES
THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT KEYWORDS AND STRUCTURES

FIXEDARR(          ) :
^^ fixed arrays need no dealloc as they are static numbers
arr bla = fixedarr(vals, len);
DUCK SIZE 64x64
    POINT 132,132
    POINT 179,179


TWO WORDS = OBJECT SUBJECT
ONE WORD  = SUBJECT OF OBJECT

SPIRAL ROTATIONS = 3
SPIRAL ............. WIDTH (RADIUS DIFFERENTIAL) = 100 pictometres
DUCKS PER GRID SQUARE = 9

WE WILL NOT CHANGE ANY FILENAMES IN THIS INSTANCE
ONLY SOURCE CODE
